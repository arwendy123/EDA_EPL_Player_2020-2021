# Exploratory Data Analysis English Premier League 2020/2021

This project aims to analyze data on goal scorers and player contributions in the English Premier League (EPL) for the 2020-2021 season. The data used is in the form of a CSV file containing information about goals scored, assists provided, yellow and red cards received, and other statistics for each player and team.

First, data processing is performed, such as calculating the number of missing and duplicated data, and checking the data types of each column in the DataFrame. Next, data processing is done to separate unnecessary columns and rename relevant columns.

Then, data visualization is carried out using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. There are plots to display the top players based on the number of goals and assists scored. Additionally, there is a scatter plot showing the efficiency of goal scorers based on their expected goals (xG) values. Data is also analyzed to determine player contributions in creating goal assists.

Furthermore, an analysis is conducted regarding the yellow and red cards given to players. In this analysis, the players with the highest number of yellow and red cards are displayed, and the correlation between yellow cards and the number of goals scored is calculated.

Moreover, an analysis is conducted on the positions of players within teams using a pie chart to show the distribution of players by position. The data is also analyzed to calculate the number of games and total minutes played by each team.

Lastly, an analysis is performed on the number of goals scored by each team. The top five teams with the highest number of goals are displayed, along with the average expected assists (xA) for each team.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive overview of player and team performance in the EPL for the 2020-2021 season. The data analysis covers goals, assists, yellow and red cards, and other statistics. Data visualization also aids in better understanding player contributions in scoring goals and creating goal assists.
